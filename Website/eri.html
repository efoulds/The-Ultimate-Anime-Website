<h3>My Opinions on Popular Animes</h3>
<p> Every year there are new animes that come out and I watch them in my free time and critique them. If you hear about a new anime and you don’t know if it is actually good or a waste of time to watch then please check out what I have to say. These are my opinions on popular animes that most anime fans have been talking about lately. These are just opinions so please do not get offended. </p>
<h4>Boku no Hero Academia</h4>
<img src="https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/12/85221l.jpg" width="240" height="333">
<p>Boku no Hero Academia blew up pretty recently and it is one of my favorite animes. It is full of action and character development. The characters are very unique and different while also being predictable. The character designs are very well thought up. Boku no Hero Academia or My Hero Academia has a pretty basic storyline about a young boy who is born without a superpower in a society run by superpowers. He goes through a lot of character development making everyone fall in love with his character. I think that this anime is great and I have no problem with it. Go watch it if you haven't!! ☺</p>
<h4>Cells at Work!</h4>
<img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/62efd37b4358eb2302a4f3c94bb85aa91530946368_full.jpg" width="240" height="333">
<p>Cells at Work is a very new anime that many people were talking about this summer. It is a very cute anime and each episode is about a different role blood cells play. It teaches you a lot about blood cells while also entertaining you with the adorable characters. I think it is a good anime to watch when you have had a long day at school or work. It doesn't have much of a story line but it's still pretty good.</p>
<h4> Black Clover</h4>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/meriendeato.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/blackclover-1.jpg?w=640&ssl=1" width="240" height="333">
<p> This anime was good when I first started watching it...The storyline was pretty basic and it wasn't very new, but it was still funny. After watching a couple episodes I got annoyed by the constant screaming made by one of the main characters. One of the main characters has a habit of screaming and it triggered me. I recommend that you read the manga and not watch the anime.</p>
<h4> Sword Art Online</h4>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE4M2M2OTYtZDgwMy00NGYwLWE0YTYtYzkyMDFjYWFhN2QzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgxODM4NjM@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,647,1000_AL_.jpg" width="220" height="333">
<p>Sword Art Online is an anime that most people hate. It was very popular for being hated. They recently made a new season where the characters are completely different and it became "better". I actually love the original characters and the storyline. The main character was pretty basic and I can understand people for hating him but the story line was very interesting. A couple years ago, when I first watched the anime I thought the idea was genius. The anime is about being caught in a VR game and I found it fascinating. I still love the anime to this day. Please give it a shot. </p>
<h4>Free!</h4>
<img src="https://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/5a459acf31a0be6fffb6207af1a9ca611532022569_full.jpg" width="220" height="333">
<p>Free is a great anime and inspired me to do exercise just like any other sports anime does. It is a pretty generic sports anime but the animation is beautiful and it makes you want to swim. I would totally recommend that you watch it if you need inspiration to work out.</p>

<h3>Hulu's Funimation Deal Takes A Chunk Out Of Netflix Anime Domination</h3>
<img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Frobsalkowitz%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2Fmyheroacademia-1200x1200.jpg" width="310" height="333">

The new partnership does not affect the current selection of Funimation shows on Hulu, which will continue to be available on the service. The move comes a year after Sony Pictures Television acquired the animation company for $143 million dollars, and several months after Funimation terminated its distribution agreement with streaming platform Crunchyroll.</p>

  <p>Some of you may think that I am making up all of the information on this website, but every single piece of information has been collected from many other trustworthy websites and gathered into one place for you.</p>
  <h3> Who I am</h3>
  <P>I am Eri Foulds and I am a professional anime watcher. I began my anime journey when I was very young....Every year, when I returned to Japan to see my grandparents, the only shows to watch on TV were animes. My childhood animes consisted of mostly Naruto and Pokemon. As I grew older I realized that there were other cartoons that weren't animes and I soon found out that anime was definitely better. Now that I am a teen I have dedicated many many hours to studying the art of Japanese cartoons. </p>
 <p> This website was created by me because I never seemed to be able to find a website that gave current news and recommended me good animes. Hopefully this website is a useful website for you. Thank you. </p>
